This is the final submission of my master thesis that is hosted on Concordia's [Spectrum repository here.](https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/987140/) It explores online kernel change point detection methods across a variety of synthetic datasets. Real market liquidity data is also analyzed using a kernel change point method.
